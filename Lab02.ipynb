The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",

    "1. The first argument to `sort` is the name of a column to sort by.\n",
    "2. If the column has text in it, `sort` will sort alphabetically; if the column has numbers, it will sort numerically.\n",
    "3. The value of `farmers_markets_locations.sort(\"x\")` is a *copy* of `farmers_markets_locations`; the `farmers_markets_locations` table doesn't get modified. For example, if we called `farmers_markets_locations.sort(\"x\")`, then running `farmers_markets_locations` by itself would still return the unsorted table.\n",
    "4. Rows always stick together when a table is sorted.  It wouldn't make sense to sort just one column and leave the other columns alone.  For example, in this case, if we sorted just the `x` column, the farmers' markets would all end up with the wrong longitudes.\n",
